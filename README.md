# Stroke Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having a stroke based on various health parameters and demographic information. Machine learning techniques are utilized to build a predictive model using a dataset containing information about patients' health attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggel](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). It contains the following features:

* gender: Gender of the patient (male, female, or other).
* age: Age of the patient.
* hypertension: Whether the patient has hypertension (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
* heart_disease: Whether the patient has heart disease (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
* ever_married: Marital status of the patient (yes or no).
* work_type: Type of occupation of the patient (e.g., private, self-employed, etc.).
* Residence_type: Type of residence of the patient (urban or rural).
* avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in the patient's blood.
* bmi: Body mass index (BMI) of the patient.
* smoking_status: Smoking status of the patient (formerly smoked, never smoked, or smokes).
* stroke: Target variable indicating whether the patient had a stroke (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook (optional, for viewing and running the notebooks)
## Libraries:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
